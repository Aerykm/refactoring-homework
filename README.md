# refactoring-homework

First off the code was sloppy in The html so I added some indentions to read the text more clearly and removed some divs that I considered unecessary. I went ahead and updated the title to something more fitting as well. Also included some element tags that removed the need for so many classes. Since I deleted the develop folder I had to re-route the image links so that they would still appear on screen.

After refactoring the html I took a look at the css and adjusted it to the new html, I had to delete a bunch of classes and cut out most styling with the way it was formatted.
